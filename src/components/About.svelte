      Hi there! I'm Sebastian, a software developer based in Denver
    </div>

  <div class="content">
    <p>
      I love learning how new systems work, which lends itself very well to
      software development! I am highly detail-oriented and organized, which is
      a strength when it comes to keeping track of all the moving parts of a
      project. I have great interpersonal skills, and a knack for explaining
      complicated things in a simple way. I love working collaboratively with
      others, and creating strong bonds with my team members, which makes me a
      particularly strong leader.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Iâ€™m not developing, you will find me working out at the gym, playing
      video games, and creating music! I love weight training, I typically work
      out at my building's gym, and have been lifting weights for 4 years. I
      play Dead by Daylight, Mario Kart, and the Binding of Isaac with my family
      members and friends on my Switch. I also play the piano, and have been
      producing music in FL Studio for 5 years.
